# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a dedicated AWS-focused projects page that showcases cloud architecture expertise through interactive technical diagrams and detailed project breakdowns. The page will demonstrate proficiency with AWS services, system design thinking, and real-world cloud implementation experience - key qualities AWS recruiters look for in internship candidates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a recruiter or hiring manager, I want to see AWS-specific projects with technical diagrams, so that I can quickly assess the candidate's cloud architecture knowledge and hands-on AWS experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the AWS projects page THEN I SHALL see a dedicated section highlighting cloud-focused projects
2. WHEN I view each AWS project THEN I SHALL see technical architecture diagrams showing connected AWS services
3. WHEN I interact with project cards THEN I SHALL see expandable sections with detailed technical information
4. WHEN I view the diagrams THEN I SHALL see proper AWS service icons and connection flows
5. WHEN I hover over diagram components THEN I SHALL see tooltips explaining each service's role

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical interviewer, I want to understand the candidate's system design decisions, so that I can evaluate their architectural thinking and problem-solving approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view an AWS project THEN I SHALL see a detailed architecture explanation section
2. WHEN I read the project description THEN I SHALL understand the business problem and technical solution
3. WHEN I review the implementation details THEN I SHALL see specific AWS services used and why they were chosen
4. WHEN I examine the project THEN I SHALL see cost considerations and scalability decisions
5. WHEN I view the technical stack THEN I SHALL see both frontend and backend technologies clearly listed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see live demonstrations of AWS projects, so that I can verify the candidate's practical implementation skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a project demo link THEN I SHALL be taken to a working application hosted on AWS
2. WHEN I view project metrics THEN I SHALL see performance data, uptime, and usage statistics
3. WHEN I access the code repository THEN I SHALL find well-documented infrastructure as code
4. WHEN I review the deployment process THEN I SHALL see CI/CD pipeline integration with AWS services
5. WHEN I examine the monitoring setup THEN I SHALL see CloudWatch dashboards and alerting configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to view AWS project diagrams on my device, so that I can explore the candidate's work regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the page on mobile THEN I SHALL see responsive diagram layouts that fit my screen
2. WHEN I interact with diagrams on touch devices THEN I SHALL be able to zoom and pan smoothly
3. WHEN I view project details on mobile THEN I SHALL see collapsible sections for better navigation
4. WHEN I switch between portrait and landscape THEN I SHALL see optimized diagram orientations
5. WHEN I load the page on slow connections THEN I SHALL see progressive loading of diagram assets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a hiring manager, I want to filter and search AWS projects by technology, so that I can quickly find relevant experience for specific roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the AWS projects page THEN I SHALL see filter options for AWS services (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
2. WHEN I select a service filter THEN I SHALL see only projects that use that specific AWS service
3. WHEN I search for keywords THEN I SHALL see projects matching the search terms in titles or descriptions
4. WHEN I apply multiple filters THEN I SHALL see projects that match all selected criteria
5. WHEN I clear filters THEN I SHALL return to the full project list view
